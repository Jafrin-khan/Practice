It took me a lot of time to understand the approach explained by people in the Discussion section.
Here's an example, explaning how I understood it:
Now, given formula for a score is
score = A[i] + A[j] + i - j ; given i < j
It becomes more easier to group the dependant values,
i.e A[i] + i and A[j] - j
In this way, when we are traversing from either sides of the array, we can just calculate that part of the score, if we maintain max of one part.

values = [7, 1, 6, 6, 9, 4, 3]
Now suppose I traverse the array from left to right, and decide to keep the sum A[i] + i maximum at each point, then I can easily use the current element value & its position to calculate the current maximum score.
Also, Note that at each point, we calculate A[j] + j and compare it to maxLeft, to always store the MAXIMUM of those values.
Let's initialize maxLeft = A[0] + 0 = 7, considering i = 0 initially. And maxScore = 0

when j = 1, 
	score = maxLeft + A[j] - j = 7 + 1 - 1 = 7
	maxScore = max(maxScore, score) = max(0,7) = 7
	maxLeft = max(maxLeft, A[j] + j) = max(7, 1+1) = 7
when j = 2, 
	score = maxLeft + A[j] - j = 7 + 6 - 2 = 11
	maxScore = max(maxScore, score) = max(7,11) = 11
	maxLeft = max(maxLeft, A[j] + j) = max(7, 6+2) = 8
when j = 3, 
	score = maxLeft + A[j] - j = 8 + 6 - 3 = 11
	maxScore = max(maxScore, score) = max(11,11) = 11
	maxLeft = max(maxLeft, A[j] + j) = max(8, 6+3) = 9
when j = 4, 
	score = maxLeft + A[j] - j = 9 + 9 - 4 = 14
	maxScore = max(maxScore, score) = max(11,14) = 14
	maxLeft = max(maxLeft, A[j] + j) = max(9, 9+4) = 13
when j = 5, 
	score = maxLeft + A[j] - j = 13 + 4 - 5 = 12
	maxScore = max(maxScore, score) = max(14,12) = 14
	maxLeft = max(maxLeft, A[j] + j) = max(13,4+5) = 13
when j = 6, 
	score = maxLeft + A[j] - j = 13 + 3 - 6 = 10
	maxScore = max(maxScore, score) = max(14,10) = 14
	maxLeft = max(maxLeft, A[j] + j) = max(13, 3+6) = 13
At the end, we return maxScore, hence our final result = 14!

The code in C++, for the same logic:

    int maxScoreSightseeingPair(vector<int>& a)
    {
        int n = a.size(), maxScore = 0;
        int maxLeft = a[0] + 0;
        for(int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            maxScore = max(maxScore, maxLeft + a[j] - j);
            maxLeft = max(maxLeft, a[j] + j);
        }
        return maxScore;
    }
    
    */
    
    int maxScoreSightseeingPair(vector<int>& values) {
        
        int score = 0;
        int maxScore = 0;
        int maxLeft = values[0] + 0;
        
        for(int j = 1 ; j < values.size() ; j++){
            score = maxLeft + values[j] - j;
            maxScore = max(maxScore , score);
            maxLeft = max(maxLeft , values[j]+j);
        }
       
        return maxScore;
    }
};
